## First time EC2 instance setup

When you have just started an EC2 instance, especially when you want
to be running docker containers, there are a bunch of steps you must
do. These scripts make it more convenient. The sequence is:

The process starts by executing the ```ec2login``` script. This does
the following:

1. resets the .ssh/known_hosts entry for instance at $ELASTIC_IP
2. copies the ```dinit``` script to the instance
3. remote executes ```dinit```

The ```dinit`` script does most of the work on the EC2 instance. It:
1. yum update
2. yum install docker git
3. start docker
4. pulls gardnerpomper/ec2docker repo
5. add ec2-user to the docker group
6. pulls and starts gardnerpomper/minimal-xfce-xvnc
7. displays the ssh command to tunnel to the containers on the instance (```dtunnel```)
