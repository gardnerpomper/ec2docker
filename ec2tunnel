# ssh into an Amazon EC2 instance that is mapped to my Elastic IP address
# Usage:
#    ec2
#
# This can also be used to set up a tunnel by appending the tunnel
# info at the command line. For example, to tunnel my local 5903 to
# remote 32772 (NOTE: -N will hang, so best to put it in the
# background):
#   ec2tunnel 5903:322773 &
#
tunnel=$(echo $1 | awk -F: '{printf("-L %s/localhost/%s",$1,$2)}')
ssh ${EC2_USER}@${ELASTIC_IP} $tunnel -N
