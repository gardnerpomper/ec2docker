# ssh into an Amazon EC2 instance that is mapped to my Elastic IP address
# Usage:
#    ec2login
#
# This can also be used to set up a tunnel by appending the tunnel
# info at the command line. For example, to tunnel my local 5903 to
# remote 32772 (NOTE: -N will hang, so best to put it in the
# background):
#    ec2login -L 5903/localhost/32772 -N &
#
sed -i '' "/${ELASTIC_IP}/d" ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh ${EC2_USER}@$ELASTIC_IP $*
